Assignment 1: Student Management System

A. Project Overview
This project is a Student Management System built with Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Goal: To manage student records and course data using a structured approach.
- Key Concepts: Includes Encapsulation, Composition, and Array Processing.

B. Class Descriptions
- Student Class: Manages individual details like GPA, credits, and ID. It uses private fields and public getters/setters to demonstrate *Encapsulation*.
- Course Class: Demonstrates *Composition* by maintaining an array of Student objects. It calculates the course average GPA and finds the student with the highest credits.

C. Instructions to Compile and Run
To run the program, use these commands in your terminal:
```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

E. Reflection
In this assignment, I practiced implementing class relationships and data protection through access modifiers. I learned that Encapsulation prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data, while Composition allows for building complex systems like a Course containing multiple Students. The main challenge was handling array logic and ensuring correct string formatting in the output. OOP principles made the code much more organized and maintainable.
